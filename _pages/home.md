### Welcome!

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations.

### About Me

I am currently working as a Research Associate in the [Multiscale Precision Instrumentation Laboratory](https://www.mpil.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/){:target="_blank"} (MPIL) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/){:target="_blank"} (CUHK). I obtained my undergraduate degree in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"} from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"} (THU) in 2013 and my Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/){:target="_blank"} (MAE) at CUHK under the guidance of [Prof. Chen Shih-Chi](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/chen-shih-chi-2/){:target="_blank"} in 2019.
